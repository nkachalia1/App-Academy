# Tic-Tac-Toe

Let's write a Tic-Tac-Toe game! Read the entire instructions before getting
started. You'll create this entire project from scratch, no skeleton. You'll
build three iterations of the game, with each iteration adding an interesting
twist on the gameplay:

- Version 1 - Basic 3x3 grid game with 2 human players
- Version 2 - Dynamic-sized grid with 2 or more human players
- Version 3 - Dynamic-sized grid with 2 or more human or computer players

## Version 1: Make it work

Below are recommendations on how to design your game. For simplicity, you'll
set up the grid with the dimensions of classic tic-tac-toe, 3x3. This can later be
changed for a dynamic grid size. Let's establish some guidelines that will
help your game take shape later.

Programmatically, you'll use a 2-dimensional array to represent the _grid_. Your
players will have unique symbols for gameplay called _marks_. An empty position
on the grid will be represented with an underscore `'_'`. Here is a sample grid:

```ruby
[
    [:X,  :O,  '_'],
    ['_', :X,  '_'],
    ['_', '_', '_'],
]
```

To refer to a _position_ of the grid, you'll use an array containing the row and
column indices. For example, the position of the first row, second column would
be `[0, 1]`; in the grid above, a `:O` appears at `[0, 1]`.

### Directory structure

You'll be building 3 classes to construct your basic game. Begin by creating a
__tic_tac_toe_v1__ directory with the following structure:

```plaintext
tic_tac_toe_v1/
  ├── board.rb
  ├── human_player.rb
  └── game.rb
```

Once you have the basic game down, you'll implement some fun additional
features! Ready?

### Board

The `Board` class is responsible for adding a player's marks, checking for
winners, and printing the game board. A board instance must have an attribute to
represent the grid. For simplicity, give the grid the dimensions of classic
tic-tac-toe, 3x3.

#### Board#initialize

A `Board` instance must have an instance variable to represent the game grid.
For now, `Board#initialize` does not need to accept any arguments. Initialize
the grid so that all positions are empty; this means that every position should
contain an underscore (`'_'`).

#### Board#valid?(position)

This method should return a boolean indicating whether or not the specified
position is valid for the board, meaning the position is not "out of bounds."

#### Board#empty?(position)

This method should return a boolean indicating whether or not the specified
position contains a player's mark.

#### Board#place_mark(position, mark)

This method should assign the given mark to the specified position of the grid.
It should raise an error when the position is not `#valid?` or not `#empty?`.

#### Checkpoint: Board yet?

At this point, you've written a few Board methods that are critical to the
gameplay. Now's a good opportunity to pause and test your code for correctness.
A quick way to test is to use pry.

You should `cd` into the project folder and run `pry`. Then, use `load
'board.rb'` to load your code into the pry environment. This should return
`true` if the file was successfully loaded. From there, play around with your
class by creating an instance and calling some methods on it! **Note:** If you
edit __board.rb__, you will need to load it into the environment again.

Here are a few sample tests to get you started, but feel free to try your
own scenarios:

```plaintext
[1] pry(main)> load 'board.rb'
=> true

[2] pry(main)> b = Board.new
=> #<Board:0x @grid=[["_", "_", "_"], ["_", "_", "_"], ["_", "_", "_"]]>

[3] pry(main)> b.place_mark([-1, 2], :X) # this should fail
RuntimeError: invalid mark
from board.rb:28:in `place_mark'

[4] pry(main)> b.place_mark([1, 2], :X)
=> :X

[5] pry(main)> b
=> #<Board:0x @grid=[["_", "_", "_"], ["_", "_", :X], ["_", "_", "_"]]>

[6] pry(main)> b.place_mark([1, 3], :X) # this should fail
RuntimeError: invalid mark
from board.rb:28:in `place_mark'

[7] pry(main)> b.place_mark([0, 0], :O)
=> :O

[8] pry(main)> b
=> #<Board:0x @grid=[[:O, "_", "_"], ["_", "_", :X], ["_", "_", "_"]]>

[9] pry(main)> b.place_mark([0, 0], :X) # this should fail
RuntimeError: invalid mark
from board.rb:28:in `place_mark'
```

Once you feel confident with your code, move forward. As a programmer, you
should test your code often as you write. If you continue to write code on top
of broken code, you may accumulate a deficit of bugs that will be hard to
isolate later on. Be methodical! You should be testing your code often, and not
just when the instructions tell you to!

#### Board#print

This method should simply print out the board and all of the marks that have
been placed on it. Feel free to style the printing as much as you'd like, but be
sure to print out each row of the board on a new line. This will help you
visualize the board better as you debug or even play the game!

#### Board#win_row?(mark)

This method should return a boolean indicating whether or not the given mark has
completely filled up any row of the grid.

#### Board#win_col?(mark)

This method should return a boolean indicating whether or not the given mark has
completely filled up any column of the grid.

#### Board#win_diagonal?(mark)

This method should return a boolean indicating whether or not the given mark has
completely filled up either diagonal of the grid.

#### Board#win?(mark)

This method should return a boolean indicating whether or not the given mark has
filled any full row, column, or diagonal.

#### Board#empty_positions?

This method should return a boolean indicating whether or not there is at least
one empty position on the grid.

#### Checkpoint: You're all winners

If you haven't already, take a moment to use pry to test your win-checking
logic. Use your `#place_mark` to set the board up and `#print` to visually
verify any winners. You can decide reasonable test scenarios. As a rule of thumb
for methods with boolean returns, be sure to test for "false-positives" and
"false-negatives". In other words, verify that `#win?` and the related methods
return true when they should **and** return false when they should. Don't forget
to test your `#empty_positions?` method as well!

### HumanPlayer

The `HumanPlayer` class is responsible for holding information about the user
and prompting them to enter a position for gameplay.

#### HumanPlayer#initialize(mark_value)

You'll allow a player to use any mark they like, so an instance of `HumanPlayer`
should have a instance variable to store their mark. The value of this mark
should be provided as an argument when creating a new player. Consider adding a
getter method for the player's mark, this may be useful later!

#### HumanPlayer#get_position

This method should prompt and allow the user to enter a valid `row col`
position. It is recommended that you ask the user to enter the position as two
numbers with a space between them. Your method should return their entered
position as an array of the form `[row, col]` so that it is compatible with the
design of your previous `Board` methods. For usability, raise an error when they
fail to enter a position in the specified format, e.g., if they enter only a
single number, use letters, or have too many spaces.

No need to verify if the position they entered is a valid position in this
class. That validation requires knowledge of the board and you want to keep your
concerns separated. Besides, you previously implemented that logic in
`Board#valid?` and `Board#empty?`.

It's also helpful if you state the player's mark when asking them to enter a
move, so they'll know whose turn it is.

#### Checkpoint: Test often, you're only human after all

This is a great time to test your work! Load your `HumanPlayer` class into pry
and test it. Here's an example of how you can test your player:

```plaintext
[1] pry(main)> load 'human_player.rb'
=> true

[2] pry(main)> player_1 = HumanPlayer.new(:X)
=> #<HumanPlayer:0x @mark=:X>

[3] pry(main)> player_1.mark
=> :X

[4] pry(main)> player_1.get_position
Player X, enter two numbers representing a position in the format `row col`
0 2
=> [0, 2]

[5] pry(main)> player_1.get_position
Player X, enter two numbers representing a position in the format `row col`
12 4
=> [12, 4]

[6] pry(main)> player_1.get_position
Player X, enter two numbers representing a position in the format `row col`
1 2 3
RuntimeError: sorry, that was invalid :(
```

Before you move on, double check that your `Player#get_position` returns an
array of **numbers** and not an array of strings. This will save you a ton of
headaches later!

### Game

The `Game` class will be the main class that houses the instances of `Board` and
`HumanPlayer` required for gameplay. It will be responsible for passing data
between the board and players. It will also contain the main game loop.

Be sure to `require` your __board.rb__ and __human_player.rb__ files into
__game.rb__.

#### Game#initialize(player_1_mark, player_2_mark)

An instance of `Game` should have instance variables for player one, player two,
and the board. Design the `#initialize` method to accept the mark values to be
used for the players.

You should also initialize an instance variable to contain the current player.
By default, player one should begin as the current player.

#### Game#switch_turn

This method should set the current player to the other player. Calling this
method repeatedly should switch the current player back and forth between the
two players.

This method is critical for gameplay so be sure to test it in pry. Here is how
your switching mechanic should perform:

```plaintext
[1] pry(main)> load 'game.rb'
=> true

[2] pry(main)> game = Game.new(:X, :O)
=> #<Game:0x0
 @current_player=#<HumanPlayer:0x @mark=:X>,
 @board=#<Board:0x @grid=[["_", "_", "_"], ["_", "_", "_"], ["_", "_", "_"]]>,
 @player_1=#<HumanPlayer:0x @mark=:X>,
 @player_2=#<HumanPlayer:0x @mark=:O>>

[3] pry(main)> game.switch_turn
=> #<HumanPlayer:0x @mark=:O>

[4] pry(main)> game
=> #<Game:0x00007f8b5ac725f8
 @current_player=#<HumanPlayer:0x @mark=:O>,
 @board=#<Board:0x @grid=[["_", "_", "_"], ["_", "_", "_"], ["_", "_", "_"]]>,
 @player_1=#<HumanPlayer:0x @mark=:X>,
 @player_2=#<HumanPlayer:0x @mark=:O>>

[5] pry(main)> game.switch_turn
=> #<HumanPlayer:0x @mark=:X>

[6] pry(main)> game
=> #<Game:0x00007f8b5ac725f8
 @current_player=#<HumanPlayer:0x @mark=:X>,
 @player_1=#<HumanPlayer:0x @mark=:X>,
 @player_2=#<HumanPlayer:0x @mark=:O>>
 @board=#<Board:0x @grid=[["_", "_", "_"], ["_", "_", "_"], ["_", "_", "_"]]>,
```

Notice how `@current_player` changes when you call `#switch_turn`. With that,
you now have all the mechanics needed to put the game together!

#### Game#play

This method will contain the main game loop. Here is some pseudocode for the
loop:

- while there exists empty positions on the board
  - print the board
  - get a position from the current player
  - place their mark at that position of the board
  - check if that user has won
    - if they win, print out a 'victory' message saying who won and return to
      end the game
    - otherwise they did not win, so switch turns
- if you finish the while loop without returning, that means there are no more
  empty positions on the board and no one has won, so print a 'draw' message

Test your game in pry. Play a few games by creating an instance of `Game` and
invoking `#play` on it. After a game is over, be sure to create a _new_ instance
of `Game` to play again, as this is the only way to get a fresh board. Some
scenarios to test are: player one winning, player two winning, and a draw.

If any errors are raised during gameplay, your game loop and `#play` method will
end immediately, so you'll have to start a new game and retry!

Congratulations, you've finished Version 1! Play a few games to celebrate, then
head on to Version 2!
